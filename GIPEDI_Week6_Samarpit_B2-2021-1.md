**Task Completed:** *Writing HDL code for 2 bit comparator network*

I had a meeting with my student mentor, Sonal ma’am, on June 18, 2021 (Friday). 

Since I was facing several errors in Verilog code which I was unable to debug, I switched to VHDL as suggested by ma’am. It took me some time to get used to the language, however I found it easier to debug as compared to Verilog and was finally able to write the code.

I proceeded with the code in a step-wise manner as follows-

- Instantiate one 2 bit comparator.
- Instantiate two 2 bit comparators and make them communicate with each other.
- Make a 2*2 network of 2 bit comparators.
- Make a 3*3 network and make sure to connect the first and last node (one 2 bit comparator) of each row and column using Round robin connection.
- Make a 4*4 network with the same approach. 

**Task Assigned:**  I am expected to implement the network on FPGA before my next meeting with Sonal ma’am on June 28, 2021 (Monday). 

I will also discuss the next task and details of the final project with her so that I can prepare my Requirement Sheet and Specifications.

**Extracurricular**: *Fundraising for an NGO.*

Since April 2021, I have been working with a Delhi-based women-led NGO - *Enlightened Kumud Trust* -which primarily works for the upliftment of underprivileged children and women. The underprivileged sections of the society are the ones which are hit worst by the pandemic; They are unable to fulfill even their basic needs. To help those in need, my team launched a fundraising campaign later this week; So far we have managed to raise more than Rs 28,000/- , collectively. We hope to reach our target i.e, Rs 1,00,000/- by the end of next week.

| Height: 14 cm                                       | Height: 15 cm; Not much increase in height but the stems have become wider which now necessitates the need of support. |
